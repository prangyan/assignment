Java program to parse a JSON file

Import the JSON folder into your local workspace. This is a maven JAVA project which will parse a JSON file present in its resource folder.
I have used eclipse as my IDE.

You can see the output in console if you run the JsonParse.java file as a java applicaiton or during mvn clean install.
